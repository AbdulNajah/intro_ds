This course will give students a foundation in the principles and practice of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data. 

We will have weekly lectures, covering a wide variety of topics including human perception, color theory, principles of visual design, etc. We will also have weekly hands-on laboratory sessions in which students will have the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice. This year, we will be adding additional emphasis on larger issues of scientific communicationâ€” after all, that's one of the main reasons we make visualizations!
